- Implementing in Java the Priority Queue ADT. Assessed Exercise 2 for Algorithms &amp; Data Structure 2 (COMPSCI2007) course in Level 2.
- Consist of 2 parts:
  -   Part 1: Implementing in Java the Priority Queue ADT using 2 different data structures.
  -   Part 2: Usign the Priority Queue to implement an algorithm for a practical problem.

## What did I learn from this:
- Using queues ADTs and how to implement them in Java.
